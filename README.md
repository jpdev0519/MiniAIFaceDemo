## Welcome to the MiniAI Face Recognition C++ Demo!
This repository contains a C++ application that demonstrates face recognition capabilities using computer vision techniques. The demo utilizes OpenCV and dlib libraries for efficient face detection and recognition.

### Key Features
 - ### Face detection: 
    The demo utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to detect faces in images or video frames, enabling a wide range of applications. 
 - ### Face recognition:
    It can recognize known faces by comparing them with a pre-defined database of individuals.
 - ### Age estimation:
    It can estimate the age of detected faces.
 - ### Gender detection:
    It can determine the gender of detected faces.
 - ### Liveness detection:
    It can detect whether a face is from a live person or a static image.

### Prerequisites
> - C++ compiler with C++11 support  
> - OpenCV (version 4.6.0)

### Installation
Clone the repository:

```java 
git clone https://github.com/MiniAI/MiniAIFaceDemo.git
```
### Usage
Run the compiled executable:
```java 
./MiniAIFaceDemo.exe
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform face detection and recognition.

### Customization
> - Face Database: Replace the sample face database with your own set of known faces. Ensure that you provide clear and properly labeled images for accurate recognition.
> - Recognition Algorithm: Adjust the recognition algorithm parameters or explore other algorithms provided by dlib to optimize the recognition performance.
